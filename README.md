## Introduction
List of Links is a curated collection of useful resources for web developers. The site contains links, screenshots and descriptions of websites, tools, tutorials, and more. Whether you're looking for inspiration, learning a new skill, or searching for a solution to a coding problem, List of Links has you covered. 
 
Users can browse the collection of resources by category or search for specific topics. The site aims to provide value to web developers of all skill levels. Each resource has been hand-picked and organized to save developers time searching the web. List of Links makes discovering high-quality web development resources simple and efficient.   
 
 Users can view resources, like posts and comment on resources. List of Links is a community platform where web developers can share knowledge and help each other improve their skills.

 The project was built keeping the Agile management principles in mind, and I utilised many of GitHub's features such as Issue and Projects to implement Scrum methodology.

[Kanban Board for project](https://github.com/users/satogako/projects/5)

[Closed Issues on GitHub for the project](https://github.com/satogako/list-of-links/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I used [GitHub issues](https://github.com/satogako/list-of-links/issues) for the product backlog containing the user stories.

CRUD functionality:
- All Categories - displays a list of resources and their approved comments
- Categories - shows resource details and its verified comments
- Approve comments - displays comments that need approval and allows the administrator to approve or delete them.
- resource_details.htm - shows details of the resource and its confirmed comments and also allows the registered user to send comments.
- class ResourseAdmirers - handles liking and disliking resources.
- class ApprovalCommentsView - displays comments that need approval and allows the administrator to approve or delete them.

I used the tags feature in GitHub Issues for assigning story points, prioritising features based on [the MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method), and categorising the user stories.

I used the [Milestones feature](https://github.com/satogako/list-of-links/milestones) to plan sprints and set deadlines.

User Stories can been seen below under [User Story Testing](#user-story-testing), and in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/satogako/list-of-links/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for full details including screenshots, story points and associated sprints.
